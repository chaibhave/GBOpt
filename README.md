# GBOpt
GBOpt is a modular Python tool that uses Monte Carlo–based optimization and structural manipulations to efficiently identify low-energy grain-boundary configurations. It supports multiple atomistic modeling engines and enables rapid exploration of grain-boundary structures in single-element systems.
